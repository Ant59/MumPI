make sure the following folders are writable:
* Mumble_PHP_Interface/tmp
* Mumble_PHP_Interface/data
* Mumble_PHP_Interface
(if you renamed Mumble_PHP_Interface, that one of course)

Make sure ppl can not access the data folder or files in it from the web.
A .htaccess file is included, but depending on your webservers configuration,
it will not be read/used or you may want to specify it in your web servers virtual host configuration.


If you don't have a default Ice ip + port (localhost), you will have to specify it in the settings file.
Otherwise it should work out of the box.

For registration to work with captchas, you will need the gd php extension loaded.
Otherwise it will not work!


The 0.3.0 includes a new settings file format, so it is not compatible with the old one.
You should make a fresh install.
